# Generalised Data Structures Library

A **C++ library** of generic data structures providing **object-oriented implementations** of both linear and non-linear data structures, along with searching and sorting algorithms. Designed using **templates** for reusability with any data type.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This library provides ready-to-use, modular, and extensible implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms. It is designed to support **clean OOP principles**, making it suitable for both academic learning and real-world software development.
